# NBA-Machine-Learning-Player-Grader

A system used to grade NBA players based on stats that correlate with winning, using regressive machine learning. It evaluates player performance from 1980 onwards, offering grades based on both standard and per36 stats. 

This tool helps identify players who contribute meaningfully to wins and then uses this to grade current/past NBA players.
